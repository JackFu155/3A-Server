3A Server Walkthrough Instructions

Part I - Set up project locally
1) Fork the https://github.com/tonethar/3A-Server-Start.git repository (Alternatively, click the "Use this template" button)
2) Rename the repository to "3A-Server"
3) Move to your PC desktop, and `git clone <url>` your forked repository
4) Change directory into 3A-Server
5) Create a package.json file: `npm init -y`
6) Download the shortid package: `npm install shortid`
7) Launch the server with: `node ./src/server.js`
8) Test the server in Chrome by heading to localhost:3000 & localhost:3000/random
9) Add "engines" key to package.json, give values for "node" and "npm"
10) Change "test" key value in package.json to "echo \"Tests Complete!\""
11) Add a "start" key to package.json, with a value of "node ./src/server.js"
12) Add a "pretest" key to package.json, with a value of "eslint ./src --fix"
13) Check out eslint at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint
14) Download the eslint packages as a developer dependency: `npm install eslint --save-dev`
15) Create an eslint config file with: `eslint --init`
  - **you will have to answer questions - please follow along with Professor!**
16) Take a look at package.json to see the new "devDependencies" keys that were added
17) `npm test` will run the "pretest" and the "test" key from package.json - be sure to fix any errors, or edit the config file to turn them into warnings (if that's the righ thing to do)
18) `npm start` will run the server. Then head to Chrome to be sure that both routes still work
